# HousingPricing

This project aims to predict house sale prices using various independent variables, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more, with sale price (Y) as the dependent variable. We employ several data preprocessing techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate predictions.

Methods
Data Preprocessing
Label Encoding: Convert categorical variables into numerical format for model compatibility.
Handling Missing Data: Filling missing values with the mode for categorical variables and 0 for numerical variables.
Correlation Analysis: Analyzing the correlation between independent variables and the target variable to select relevant features.
Model Building
We have applied the following machine learning algorithms for house price prediction:

Linear Regression: Achieved an accuracy of 89.6%.
Random Forest Regressor: Achieved an accuracy of 89.5%.
Gradient Boosting Regressor: Achieved the highest accuracy of 91.8%.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about various houses and their sale prices. It includes both numerical and categorical features, making it suitable for regression analysis.
